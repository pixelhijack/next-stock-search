# next-stock-search

## dev log:

- latest next.js requires node 18.18
- brew installed nvm to update node
- fixed ~/.bashrc and PATH variable
- installed node 18.18
- Node.js version 18.18 was built for macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later, but running macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) version mismatch causes the dynamic linker (dyld) to fail because your system libraries donâ€™t support newer macOS features
- nvm downgrade node to v16 as MacOs upgrade is not an option
- using a prebuilt next.js template by manually installing dependencies
- Next.js v11 is the latest compatible version
- nextjs.org doesn't have documentation prior to v15
- there is a github issue page on how to find older documentation https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/17548
- next.js v11 documentation available in the github repo history

- api key to local env
- basic hardcoded fetch api url
- basic display view for the response data
- search field with loading, query, data, error states
- Alpha Vantage daily 25 request rate limit exceeded...
- temp fix: response json served as mock data if live API hit daily rate limit

- tailwind & deps added w/ configuration
- tailwind is compiled right but will not be displayed as there is a tailwind vs outdated react/next version mismatch (`content` field in `tailwind.config.js`)

## Possible next steps

- find which tailwind version is compatible with this version of react/next. Style the components, remove inline vanilla styles and replace with tailwind, add media-queries for responsive views
- split index.js to /components
- schema validation and backend keys remap for better usability on the frontend (`stock["2. name"]` -> `stock.name`)
- more robust error / mock handling
- for detail/[stock].js view, display stock details (possible solutions: 1. re-query the API via the stock name on detail view load, 2. pass original query results via query params 3. use Global State provider-context which might not be possible with this React version)
- vercel deployment (install vercel CLI, create new project on Vercel Dashboard, configure git repo with Next.js Framework Preset, configure env variables for the API key, verify deployment -> tailwind will not work without the `content` field version mismatch)
- add Server-Side Rendering (create page component, wrap context with `getServerSideProps`)
- add second API call for detail view to pull stock prices for the given stock name
- persist already requested / frequent favourite stocks (1. client-side cache via React State or Context if version wouldn't be outdated 2. localStorage 3. server-side caching, SSG-ISR, Cache-headers etc)
