dev log:

- latest next.js requires node 18.18
- brew installed nvm to update node
- fixed ~/.bashrc and PATH variable
- installed node 18.18
- Node.js version 18.18 was built for macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later, but running macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) version mismatch causes the dynamic linker (dyld) to fail because your system libraries donâ€™t support newer macOS features
- nvm downgrade node to v16 as MacOs upgrade is not an option
- using a prebuilt next.js template by manually installing dependencies
- Next.js v11 is the latest compatible version
- nextjs.org doesn't have documentation prior to v15
- there is a github issue page on how to find older documentation https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/17548
- next.js v11 documentation available in the github repo history
